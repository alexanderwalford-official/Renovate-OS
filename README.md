# Renovate-OS
 Official repo for Renovate OS, written entirely in C and assembly language.

## What is Renovate OS?
It's an opensource operating system that can execute RenGets both natively and remotely on an external server. The final goal is to have an easy to use programming interface that incoperates functionality from the programming language "RenLang". 

## But why basic C?
It offers a programming interface that is more convient than assembly language. However, assembly language will be used to implement core functionality as that is the only way this can be accomplished. 

## Why not just use the Linux kernel?
Building an operating system from the ground up that can run on bare metal is quite the accomplishment. By using a custom codebase, Renovate OS can be made far more versitile and even faster than Linux. Renovate OS is supposed to be the prime example of what a perfectly balanced platform should look like; with the implementation of only running RenGets that meet our specifications. 

## Where's the assembly?
I've decided to use inline assmembly in C with the GCC GNU99 standard for the most part when developing this operating system to keep things a little bit cleaner. Also, this allows me to break into assembly whenever I may need to do so without having to compile external files. 

## Tools Used
- Visual Studio Code IDE
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- GCC GNU99
- NASM X86 ASM
- Qemu i386 & Virtual Box
- GNU GRUB
- Makefile
